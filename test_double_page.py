Another paragraph here with different content.

And yet another paragraph to test the pagination.

This should demonstrate how double page mode works.

Each page will be displayed side by side like in a real book.

The left page shows the first content.

And the right page shows the next content.

This creates a more natural reading experience.

Especially for users who prefer book-like layouts.

You can toggle between single and double page modes.

Press 'd' to switch between the two modes.

The separator character helps distinguish the pages.

This is the end of our test content."""
